# Arrays
- Arrays store information contiguously.
- As each element of an array has a memory slot, and all array elements need to be next to each other, we need to allocate N contiguous slots on memory. It can be hard to find them and every time we need a new slot we need to relocate the whole array if we dont find free slots around.
